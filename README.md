## 🔍 Overview
### About the Project
**KeyMon** is an interactive, console-based keylogger designed for cybersecurity education and system monitoring. Built with Python and the `pynput` library, it features a bold, professional terminal interface that allows users to configure logging paths and control the monitoring process in real-time. This project demonstrates low-level input hooking and file I/O operations while emphasizing ethical usage.

## 🛠️ What It Does
* **Real-time Keystroke Monitoring:** Captures both alphanumeric and special keys.
* **Custom Storage Path:** Interactive menu to select where to save logs.
* **Bold Console UI:** High-contrast ASCII art and color-coded status updates.
* **Manual Control:** Dedicated start/stop functionality via the control panel.
* **Modular Design:** Built with clean, reusable Python classes.

## ⚙️ How It Works

| | | |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **01** Background Listener hooks into system input via `pynput`. | **02** Event Handlers differentiate between chars and special keys. | **03** Logging Module appends data with high-precision timestamps. |
| **04** Dynamic Pathing verifies directory existence before writing. | **05** ANSI Escape Codes provide the bold, colorful terminal UI. | **06** Safe Termination allows for graceful listener shutdown. |
